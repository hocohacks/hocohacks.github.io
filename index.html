                      HocoHacks is Howard County's high school hackathon, where students from various middle and high schools across the county will get the opportunity to collaborate on coding projects and compete for prizes. Whether you want to learn to code, or to flex your coding abilities, HocoHacks brings together coders of all different skill sets to collectively promote the knowledge of code.</br></br>
                      Additionally, this year we will have two divisions a middle school and high school division. Middle schoolers can compete in the high school division at their own discretion. If one member on the team is in high school, then that team must compete in the high school division. The theme of the hackathon will be revealed day of, but you can
                      always start brainstorming ideas!
