                <p style="color: red">Due to COVID-19 concerns and Governor Hogan's stay-at-home order, HocoHacks is cancelled for the 2019-20 school year. Stay home, wash your hands, and we hope to be up and running again in 2021!</p>
                <p>HocoHacks is Howard County's high school hackathon, where students from various middle and high schools across the county will get the opportunity to collaborate on coding projects and compete for prizes. Whether you want to learn to code, or to flex your coding abilities, HocoHacks brings together coders of all different skill sets to collectively promote the knowledge of code.</p>

                <h1 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                <div><b>What is a Hackathon?</b><p>A Hackathon is an event that brings novice and experienced coders together in order to create innovative projects involving code.</p></div>
                <div><b>Do I need to know how to code?</b><p>No, you don't! Even if you aren't able to code beforehand, you can attend workshops to learn some code (Java or AppDev), and still submit a project.</p></div>
                <div><b>Who can attend?</b><p>HocoHacks is open to all middle and high school students. However, anyone is welcome to drop by and see what participants are working on.</p></div>
                <div><b>What's the team limit and what if I don't have a team?</b><p>No problem! Many participants arrive without a team, and you can meet and work with new people. You can also choose to work alone. The limit is 3 people per team.</p></div>
                <div><b>What is the topic and what can I make?</b><p>The topic will be revealed on the day of the hackathon (so as to avoid cheating). For your hack, possibilities are websites, mobile or desktop apps, or even hardware projects. </p></div>
                <div><b>How much does it cost?</b><p>HocoHacks is free for all participants! We provide food, beverages, workspaces, and "swag" (free stuff).</p></div>
                <div><b>What should I bring?</b><p>We recommend that you bring a laptop (and your best thinking mind). Laptops aren't required, but it won't be easy to code on lined paper.</p></div>
                <div><b>Can I use past projects?</b><p>Anyone caught working on past projects will be forced to sit in the corner and wear the dunce hat. Don't give yourself an unfair advantage over your fellow competitors.</p></div>
                <div><b>Will hardware be provided?</b><p>Each participant/team must bring his or her own hardware. School computers are off-limits for hackathon use.</p></div>
                <div><b>How do I win?</b><p>The judges are looking for original, innovative, and well-functioning projects. Bonus points for a project with real-world applicability!</p></div>
                <div><b>Is there a code of conduct?</b><p>All normal Howard County school rules apply.</p></div>
